# Zeyu's Pentesting Writeups

## ~\# man Pentesting

Penetration testing is a security exercise where a penetration tester attempts to find and exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system.

There are many platforms that offer virtual penetration testing labs. I publish writeups on machines from some of these platforms.
