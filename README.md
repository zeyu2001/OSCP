# Zeyu's Pentesting Writeups

## ~\# man Pentesting

Penetration testing is a security exercise where a penetration tester attempts to find and exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system.

There are many platforms that offer virtual penetration testing labs. I publish writeups on machines from some of these platforms.

## ~\# ls -la

| Platform | Writeups |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Proving Grounds - Offensive Security](./#cd-proving_grounds) | 14 |
| [Hack the Box](./#cd-hack_the_box) | 7 |

## ~\# cd proving\_grounds

[Offensive Security Proving Grounds \(PG\) ](https://www.offensive-security.com/labs/)are a modern network for practicing penetration testing skills on exploitable, real-world vectors.
